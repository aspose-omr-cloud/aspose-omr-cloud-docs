**Aspose.OMR Cloud** is an online service for recognizing hand-filled answer sheets, surveys, questionnaires, tests, and other machine-readable forms. With it, you can easily add optical mark recognition (OMR) functionality to almost any device or platform, including netbooks, mini PCs, or even entry-level smartphones. All resource-intensive tasks run on highly reliable and high performance cloud servers, ensuring the fastest possible speed regardless of the number of requests.

Our REST API works with any paper-based OMR forms. It can read scanned images and photos without specialized devices. Respondents can fill out your forms with a pen or pencil and use any type of marks - artificial intelligence and advanced accuracy calibration ensure reliable results. 

In addition to form recognition, Aspose.OMR Cloud can generate professional print forms, from examination papers to customer satisfaction surveys and election ballots. A versatile markup language allows you to combine various elements that best suit your purpose and target audience. You can further personalize and brand OMR forms by adding logos, barcodes, QR codes, or images.

Even the complex recognition tasks can be done in a single API call. You do not need to install any software to use our OMR cloud services. Just use cURL commands or combine them into scripts for complex tasks. You can also use third party REST API tools like Postman.
