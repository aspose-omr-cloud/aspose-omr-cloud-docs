**Aspose.OMR Cloud** is an on-demand cloud-based service. As such, it has no specific device or operating system requirements and can be used with any programming language that supports HTTPS requests: .NET, Java, JavaScript (Node.js and AJAX), Python, and many more. It can run on servers, desktops, thin clients, smartphones and tablets.

You can even use our OMR cloud services without installing any software (including SDKs). Just use cURL commands or combine them into scripts for complex tasks. You can also use third party REST API tools like Postman.

The only requirement is that the device must have access to the Internet and the application must not be blocked by a firewall.
