Aspose.OMR Cloud is an online service for automatically extracting content from machine-readable forms. It can process hand-filled answer sheets, surveys, tests, ballots, SAT exam forms, insurance claims, and similar documents in which respondents answer a question by drawing a random mark in a circle or square. The long and error-prone process of manually reading and aggregating results from hundreds and thousands of forms comes down to a single REST API call, accessible even to inexperienced developers.

Our REST API works with a highly flexible markup language that allows you to create machine-readable forms of any layout and complexity without design tools. You can combine different elements that best suit your purpose and target audience, and further personalize and brand your OMR forms by adding logos, barcodes, QR codes or images.

Aspose.OMR Cloud comes with open-source software development kits (SDKs) for .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, and other programming languages, which handle all the routine operations such as establishing connections, sending API requests, and parsing responses.
